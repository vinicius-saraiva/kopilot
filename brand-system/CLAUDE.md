# Brand System

Two core resources:

- **`brand-system.md`** — AI-readable design reference. Use this to understand design tokens, voice & tone, and visual guidelines when writing specs.
- **Website** (`brand-system.html` / hosted via GitHub Pages) — Visual reference for humans to browse the brand system and download assets.
